defmodule PhoenixKitProjects.Assignees do
  @moduledoc """
  The single resolver for "whose work is this?" questions against the
  polymorphic assignment assignee (person OR team OR department).

  A person's **effective scope** is themselves plus one level of inherited
  membership: the teams they belong to (staff `TeamMembership`) and the
  departments those teams sit in plus their own primary department. One level
  only, by design — transitive roll-ups (team of team, parent departments)
  don't exist in the staff model and would be guesswork here.

  `match/2` answers whether an assignment falls in a scope and HOW — `:direct`
  or `{:team, name}` / `{:department, name}` — so UIs can show provenance
  ("via Engineering") instead of implying personal ownership. Consumers pick
  their semantics: inherited = any match; direct-only = `:direct` matches.

  Built for the Overview calendar's assignee filter, but deliberately
  UI-agnostic: any future per-person surface (widgets, queues, a staff-side
  consumer via an events contract) should resolve through this module rather
  than re-deriving membership joins — the panel-review risk was exactly this
  logic drifting between call sites.

  Staff reads are rescued to safe defaults (same convention as
  `Projects.list_assignments_for_user/1`) — an assignee filter must never
  crash the dashboard.

  Searches people for the assignee picker (core `<.search_picker>` contract):
  name/email typeahead, LIMITed at the database (limit+1 probes `has_more` for
  the picker's Load more), trashed people excluded. An empty query is browse
  mode — the first page, name-sorted — per the workspace picker rule that a
  picker must offer options before any typing.

  **Only relevant people are offered**: someone at least one non-template
  assignment points at — directly, via a team they belong to, or via a
  department in their one-level scope (their teams' departments + their
  primary department). A person no task has ever touched would only ever
  filter the calendar to an empty month, so the picker doesn't suggest them
  (and on a fresh install with no projects it correctly offers nobody).
  `opts[:project_uuids]` narrows relevance to assignments of the given
  projects — the per-project Calendar tab passes its rendered tree so the
  picker offers only that project's people.

  Returns `{rows, has_more}` where each row is the picker's
  `%{kind:, uuid:, label:, sublabel:, icon:}` shape. `{[], false}` on a
  failed staff read. `opts[:exclude]` drops the given person uuids at the
  database (already-picked chips shouldn't reappear as suggestions) without
  disturbing the page/`has_more` math.

  Queries the staff `Person` schema directly (already a hard schema dep via
  the assignment FKs) because the staff context's `list_people/1` has no
  LIMIT — the whole point here is not loading 1000 people per keystroke.
