defmodule PhoenixKitProjects.Errors do
  @moduledoc """
  Atom → translated-string dispatcher for Projects context errors.

  Context functions return `{:error, atom}` (or `{:error, %Ecto.Changeset{}}`
  for changeset errors); LiveViews call `Errors.message/1` at the
  presentation boundary to translate the atom into a flash-ready
  user-facing string.

  Keeping the dispatcher here means:

  1. Translation files only need to know about the literal strings
     in this module — the gettext extractor sees the literals at the
     `gettext(...)` call site of each branch.
  2. Context functions stay storage-agnostic (no `gettext` calls in
     `lib/phoenix_kit_projects/projects.ex`); LiveViews are the one
     place that turns intent into copy.
  3. Future changes to wording happen in one place; new error
     conditions get a new atom + a new branch here.

  Translates a Projects error atom into a user-facing message.

  Defaults to a generic fallback for unknown atoms so callers always
  get a renderable string (no raised pattern-match) — but a fallback
  that fires in production is a sign that a context fn returned an
  atom this module doesn't know about, and should be added here.
