defmodule PhoenixKitProjects.Web.Crumbs do
  @moduledoc """
  The admin header's breadcrumb trail for this module's pages — one place
  for the rules, so every LiveView reads the same way (panel round with
  codex/grok/zai, 2026-09-05):

      Admin Panel / Projects / …                      every page of the module
      Admin Panel / Projects / Tasks / New task        subtab pages: subtab label as the crumb
      Admin Panel / Projects / Test / Files            sub-pages are crumbs, not "Test · Files"
      Admin Panel / Projects / Parent / Child          sub-projects show their parent chain
      Admin Panel / Projects / Test / Add task         "Add" attaches to the project crumb…
      Admin Panel / Projects / Tasks / New task        …"New" creates a standalone record
      Admin Panel / Projects / Test / Edit             edit: the record is a crumb, the leaf is "Edit"
      Admin Panel / Projects / Tasks / Measure / Edit  a record with no page of its own is a text crumb

  The trail is core's contract (core's `dev_docs/guides/2026-09-25-admin-
  header-trail.md`): `page_section` (+ `page_section_path`) is the module
  tab, `page_crumbs` the linked middle, `page_title` the plain leaf — never
  a trail of its own. The project's List/Board/Timeline/Calendar tabs are
  views of one place and never appear. Crumb labels reuse the subtab
  labels verbatim so the trail mirrors the sidebar.

  Known limit of the core contract, not fixed here: `page_title` is also
  the browser tab title, so a short leaf ("Files", "Edit") makes a weak
  tab title. Every panel seat flagged it — the fix is a separate
  browser-title assign in core. A form opened in a drawer has no trail at
  all, so its in-form heading still names the record (`heading`, see
  `Web.Helpers.keep_host_title/1`).
