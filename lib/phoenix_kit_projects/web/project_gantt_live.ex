  Gantt / waterfall view of a project — the same data as
  `ProjectShowLive`, rendered as horizontal bars on a date axis via the
  `PhoenixLiveGantt` component instead of the vertical timeline.

  Read-only: it visualizes the project's assignments as a sequential
  schedule (each task starts where the previous one ends, honoring the
  project's weekday/weekend rules via `Project.eta_from/3`) and draws
  dependency arrows between them. Mutations still happen on the vertical
  show page; the two views share the project UUID.
