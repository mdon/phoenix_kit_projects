  `phoenix_kit_dashboard_slots/0` contract (no dependency on
  `phoenix_kit_dashboards`, no `@impl`, exactly like `phoenix_kit_widgets/0`).

  Declaring these is CONSENT. The dashboards package is able to inject a
  sub-tab under any module's sidebar entry without asking — core groups
  sub-tabs by parent id with no ownership check — and deliberately does not.
  Nothing appears under Projects that is not declared right here.

  Two places:

  * **Projects dashboard** — a sidebar sub-tab beside the list and the
    Overview. Context-free: it is about the whole module, so widgets bound to
    "the project this page is about" have nothing to read and say so. A widget
    bound to *the viewer's own* project resolves fine here, which is what makes
    one shared board work for every project manager.
  * **Project page** — the Dashboard tab inside a project. It supplies
    `projects.project`, so one shared board serves every project instead of
    needing a copy each. It is the SAME tab this module's dashboard extension
    contributes, and the two settle by specificity: a project that picks its
    own board in its Modules panel overrides the placement, everything else
    follows it.

  The list stays the project list: neither slot is a landing page. An overview
  and a dashboard are different things, which is why Dashboard sits next to
  Overview rather than replacing it.

  Resolves "**my** project" for a viewer — the `viewer` bind source in the
  dashboards package.

  This is the half of the design that a page subject cannot supply: a shared
  "Project managers" dashboard in the sidebar has no current project, yet each
  manager needs their own. Only this module can answer that question, so the
  dashboards package asks rather than guessing.

  Deliberately conservative. It answers only when there is exactly ONE project
  the viewer can reach, and otherwise `nil` — which renders as "pick a project"
  rather than a confident wrong answer. Guessing "most recently visited" was
  considered and rejected: it is wrong every Monday morning, and being silently
  shown the wrong project's numbers is worse than being shown none.
