defmodule PhoenixKitProjects.Web.WidgetsResilienceTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Pins the AGENTS.md widget invariant: **a widget must never crash the host
  dashboard**. Two real failure shapes are exercised:

  - a read that raises mid-update (a malformed viewer uuid escapes
    `list_assignments_for_user/1`'s own rescue as an `Ecto.Query.CastError`) —
    the widget-level rescue renders the empty state instead of taking down the
    host LiveView;
  - a process with no DB access at all (a `Task` without a sandbox allowance —
    the same shape as a transient connection loss), where every widget must
    still render.
