# Changelog

## 0.13.0 - 2026-06-22

**Timeline (Gantt) lays tasks out in dependency order.** A prerequisite is now always charted before the task that depends on it — even when it was drag-positioned later — so finish-to-start arrows point forward instead of rendering as backward red "conflict" detours. Pairs with `phoenix_live_gantt` 0.2.0 (whole-week/month axis snapping, date-range week labels, solid arrowheads).

### Fixed

- **A prerequisite positioned after its dependent drew a backward "conflict" arrow.** When a prerequisite task was positioned (drag order) *after* the task depending on it, `ProjectGanttLive` laid the waterfall out by raw `position`, so the prerequisite was scheduled later and its finish-to-start connector pointed backward — a red dashed "conflict" detour — forcing the dependent's bar to weave around the misplaced prerequisite. The view now orders each project's assignments topologically (prerequisites first, drag-`position` as the tiebreaker) before the waterfall. No-op when the manual order already respects dependencies; cycle-safe (degrades to position order); out-of-scope dependencies are ignored.

### Changed

- **Dependency upgrade — `phoenix_live_gantt` → 0.2.0**, picked up automatically via the floating `~> 0.1` pin: whole-week/month axis snapping, date-range week labels, and solid arrowheads. Other transitive lock bumps: `phoenix_kit_ai` 0.10.0, `req` 0.6.2, `mdex` 0.13.1 / `mdex_native` 0.2.2. No `mix.exs` requirement-floor changes.

### Internal

- `order_by_dependencies/2` no longer re-sorts by `position` before the topological pass — `list_assignments` already returns rows position-ordered, so the sort was a no-op. The Gantt bar-position test helper now fails loudly on a markup miss instead of defaulting to `0.0` (which would have let the `<=` assertion pass trivially).

## 0.12.0 - 2026-06-18

**Timeline tab in embedded project views + host-insertable Gantt.** A host that embeds `ProjectShowLive` now gets the **List / Timeline** tab pair (previously embeds were list-only), and `ProjectGanttLive` (the Timeline view) is now in the embeddable-LV whitelist so hosts can insert it directly. URL-sync stays opt-in and off by default for embeds, so an embedded page never rewrites the host's address bar.

### Added

- **Timeline tab renders in embeds.** The List/Timeline tab bar now renders in every `ProjectShowLive` mount context (only templates stay list-only). The Timeline tab is a nested `live_render` of `ProjectGanttLive` — server-rendered SVG, so the chart shows even before any JS loads. The gantt stays lazy-mounted (only `live_render`ed once its tab is first opened) so a list-only embed pays nothing for it.
- **`ProjectGanttLive` is host-insertable.** Added to `Web.Helpers.embeddable_lvs/0` so `PopupHostLive` (`root_view`), `<.smart_link emit>`, emit `:opened`, and `next` frames can insert the Timeline view by module — the admin tab always rendered it via a direct `live_render`, which never consulted the whitelist, so it ran in our own UI yet stayed un-insertable by other apps. **All 10 LVs are now embeddable.**
- **`session["tab_url_sync"]` embed key** (`ProjectShowLive` only). Boolean, **defaults `false`** in embeds. Pass `true` (a real boolean) to opt an embed into `/gantt` deep-linking via the `ProjectTabsUrl` hook; the router-mounted standalone admin page enables it implicitly so its existing deep-linking keeps working.

### Changed

- **Embedded `ProjectShowLive` no longer rewrites the host URL on tab switch.** URL sync is off by default in embeds — `switch_tab` only pushes the `project_tab_url` event when `tab_url_sync?` is on, and the `ProjectTabsUrl` hook isn't attached otherwise. The tabs still switch instantly with or without it.
- **Dependency upgrade** — `phoenix_kit` → 1.7.162.

### Internal

- Embedding regression coverage grown to 43 `live_isolated/3` tests: `ProjectGanttLive` embed (off-router mount, `wrapper_class` override, whitelist round-trip through the `decode_embeddable_lv/1` decoder), embedded `ProjectShowLive` rendering the tab bar with a still-lazy gantt, and the URL-sync default-off / opt-in pair. `AGENTS.md` + `dev_docs/embedding_*` updated for the contract change (incl. the host-side gantt-JS-hooks note for the embedded Timeline).

## 0.11.0 - 2026-06-18

**Embedded current-user identity + broadcast-after-commit correctness.** Fixes the reported bug where the integrated comments composer showed *"Sign in to post a comment."* when an embeddable LiveView is rendered in a host app, and hardens every projects mutation so a rolled-back transaction can no longer leak a PubSub event.

### Fixed

- **Embedded comments composer + activity actor recorded no user.** An LV mounted via `live_render` (`:not_mounted_at_router`) never runs core's `:phoenix_kit_ensure_admin` `on_mount`, so `phoenix_kit_current_scope` / `phoenix_kit_current_user` were absent — the comments drawer flipped to *"Sign in to post a comment."* and `Activity.actor_uuid/1` logged `nil` for every embedded mutation. The host now bridges identity via `session["current_user_uuid"]` (a string uuid, never the `%User{}` struct), which `Web.Helpers.assign_embed_user/2` reloads into the scope at mount. Wired into all nine embeddable LVs, the nested gantt hop, the global settings panel, and `PopupHostLive` (which forwards the key into the root view and every stacked frame). Unknown / inactive / DB-error uuids degrade to anonymous, never a crash.
- **Phantom PubSub events on rollback.** Every in-transaction broadcast (`:project_deleted`, `:assignment_created`, `:project_completed`/`:project_reopened`, and the clone / closure-pull / template-dependency fan-out) now fires only *after* the enclosing transaction commits, so a rollback can no longer leak an event for a row that never persisted.
- **Gantt mount race.** `ProjectGanttLive` now subscribes to the root project's topic *before* its initial read, so a broadcast landing while the tree is building isn't dropped.

### Changed

- **Emit `:saved` payload trimmed (contract change for emit-mode hosts).** `{:projects, :saved, …}` now carries `record: %{uuid: …}` instead of the full Ecto struct — a preloaded record could ship user PII over a host-relayed, client-readable session. The `kind` conveys the type; a host that needs the record re-fetches it by uuid.
- **New `current_user_uuid` embed-session key**, documented in `dev_docs/embedding_emit.md`. Identity reconstruction drives audit attribution + the comments composer, **not authorization** — embedded mounts run no admin `on_mount`, so the host MUST gate the embedding page itself (a previously incorrect "embedded LVs self-gate" claim in the docs is corrected).
- **`broadcast: false` opt** added to `create_project/2`, `create_assignment/2`, and `add_dependency/3` (default `true`, backward compatible) so callers inside a larger transaction emit a single event after commit.
- **Dependency upgrades** — `phoenix_kit` → 1.7.161, `phoenix_kit_ai` → 0.9.0, `phoenix_kit_staff` → 0.6.0, `phoenix_kit_comments` → 0.2.11, `phoenix_live_view` → 1.2.3 (markdown handling in the dependency tree moved off `earmark` to `mdex`). No requirement-floor changes — existing constraints already admit the new versions.
- **`@spec` coverage** added across `paths`, `pub_sub`, `activity`, `l10n`, the web helpers, and every schema `changeset`.

### Internal

- Broadcast-suppression and embed actor-attribution regression tests (embed create → `assert_activity_logged`, inactive / empty / unknown-uuid degradation, `PopupHostLive` forwarding, settings-panel embed actor), plus Task changeset edge cases. `.dialyzer_ignore.exs` pruned of four stale filters for files removed in the AI-translation migration.

## 0.10.0 - 2026-06-14

**Gantt / Timeline view for projects.** The project show page gains a **List / Timeline** tab pair under the shared header. The new Timeline (`ProjectGanttLive`, on the [`phoenix_live_gantt`](https://hex.pm/packages/phoenix_live_gantt) package) renders the project's assignments as an hour-precise sequential schedule with dependency arrows, sub-project roll-ups, and live updates across the whole sub-project tree.

### Added

- **Timeline tab** — URL-driven (`/list/:id/gantt`) and instant (lazy-mounted with a loading skeleton on first open, then kept so zoom/expand survive tab switches). 5m/15m/hour/day/week/month zooms with auto-fit, timeline pagination, stable hierarchical row order, and fully localized chrome. Templates and embedded/emit renders stay list-only.
- **Zero-config module assets** — `css_sources/0` now includes `:phoenix_live_gantt` so the host's Tailwind scans the gantt classes with no manual `@source`. A new `js_sources/0` declares the gantt hook bundle for core's `:phoenix_kit_js_sources` compiler (a harmless no-op until that core release ships; the CSS resolves against current core today).
- **AI-translate on the assignment form** — the one-click AI-translate button/modal now covers the assignment `description` (the last translatable form that was missing it), matching the project/task/template forms. The description disables while a translation is in flight.

### Fixed

- **`NotLoaded` crash on `:project_updated`** — the lifecycle PubSub handler reloaded the project without the assignee preload, crashing the re-render for any project with an assignee (e.g. a second admin tab editing). Now reloads via `get_project_with_assignee/1`. Pinned by a regression test.
- **Blank page for a template on the `/gantt` route** — a template uuid reached via `/list/:id/gantt` resolved to the gantt tab, but the tab bar and gantt are both template-excluded, so the page rendered empty. Templates now pin to the List tab.

### Changed

- **Dependency upgrades** — `phoenix_kit` → 1.7.145, `phoenix_kit_ai` → 0.8.0, `phoenix_live_view` → 1.2.1, `phoenix` → 1.8.8 (plus `leaf`, `phoenix_kit_comments`, `phoenix_kit_entities`). No requirement-floor changes — existing constraints already admit the new versions.
- **Fused schedule + progress card** — the schedule summary and progress bar on the show page now read as one card (the progress bar is the card's bottom edge).
- **Assignment edit form polish** — the page title now names the task (“Edit task: …”); the language tabs connect to the description with a skeleton on switch; dropped the redundant “Task:” line and “Details” divider.
- **`version/0` reads `mix.exs @version`** so the module version can't drift from the release version.
- **Deduped schedule/assignee helpers** shared by `ProjectShowLive` and `ProjectGanttLive` into `Web.Helpers` (the extracted `assignment_hours/2` is now nil-safe for sub-project links).

## 0.9.3 - 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- **HexDocs warning** — `AITranslatable`'s moduledoc referenced the now-removed `c:PhoenixKit.Module.ai_translatables/0` callback (core dropped the callback in the AI-translation move). It now links the plain `PhoenixKitProjects.ai_translatables/0` function that PhoenixKitAI discovers by duck-typing, and the surrounding prose credits PhoenixKitAI (not core) for the pipeline. Docs-only; no code change.

## 0.9.2 - 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- **`phoenix_kit_ai` floor raised to `~> 0.4`** — the AI-translation move (`PhoenixKitAI.{Translatable,Translations,Components.AITranslate.*}`) actually ships in `phoenix_kit_ai` 0.4.0. The previous `~> 0.3` floor (shipped in 0.9.0/0.9.1) resolved to 0.3.0, which predates the move and fails to compile against this module's `AITranslatable` / `AITranslateBinding` / form LVs. Fresh installs of 0.9.0/0.9.1 were broken; this corrects the constraint.

### Changed

- Reordered the `PhoenixKitAI.Components.AITranslate.FormGlue` alias in the project/task/template form LiveViews so the `PhoenixKitAI.*` alias sorts ahead of `PhoenixKitProjects.*` (Credo `--strict` alphabetical-alias check). No behavior change.

## 0.9.1 - 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- **HexDocs warning** — `AITranslatable`'s moduledoc referenced the hidden `ai_translatables/0` impl as a function link; now points at the `c:PhoenixKit.Module.ai_translatables/0` callback instead. Docs-only; no code change.

## 0.9.0 - 2026-06-04

**AI translation now runs on the shared PhoenixKitAI pipeline.** The module's bespoke AI-translation stack (its own `Translations` context, `TranslateResourceWorker`, and `AITranslateBar`) is replaced by PhoenixKitAI's generic pipeline plus the shared translate modal/glue — the same one catalogue uses. Net deletion of ~3300 lines of duplicated machinery. Translatable fields are unchanged (project/template: `name` + `description`; task: `title` + `description`; assignment: `description`), stored as before in each schema's `translations` JSONB.

### Added

- **`PhoenixKitProjects.AITranslatable`** — the `PhoenixKitAI.Translatable` adapter for the four resource types (`project`, `template`, `task`, `assignment`), registered via `ai_translatables/0`. `source_fields/2` reads each schema's `translatable_fields/0` from `translations[lang]` or the primary column; `put_translation/4` merges results into the `translations` JSONB under a `FOR UPDATE` row lock so concurrent per-language jobs can't drop sibling languages; `fetch/2` validates the `is_template` flag so a project job can't cross-translate a template (or vice versa).
- **`PhoenixKitProjects.AITranslateBinding`** — the `PhoenixKitAI.Components.AITranslate.FormBinding` for the project/task/template form LVs (existing-translation langs, changeset merge, actor uuid).
- **"Taking a while" stall hint** on bulk translations — comes for free from the shared `FormGlue`.
- Adapter unit tests (`fetch` with `is_template` validation, `source_fields` column/override/blank handling, `put_translation` merge + `:resource_not_found` rollback).

### Changed

- **Added `phoenix_kit_ai ~> 0.3`** — the AI plugin now owns the generic translation pipeline (`PhoenixKitAI.{Translatable,Translations,TranslateWorker}` + the shared `AITranslate.{FormGlue,FormBinding}` UI) this module depends on.
- The project/task/template form LVs delegate their AI-translate wiring to the shared `FormGlue` instead of carrying an inline copy of the dispatch/config/handle_info state machine.
- The per-translation audit entry is now core's generic `ai.translation_added` (module `"ai"`) rather than `projects.translation_added`.
- `update_task/3` and `update_assignment_form/3` gain a `broadcast: false` option (mirroring `update_project/3`); the translation adapter passes it so a write inside its `FOR UPDATE` transaction doesn't fire a pre-commit `:*_updated` broadcast. Existing 2-arity callers are unaffected.

### Removed

- The bespoke `PhoenixKitProjects.Translations` context, `Workers.TranslateResourceWorker`, and `Web.Components.AITranslateBar` (plus the `Web.AITranslateFormHelpers` module) — behaviour is now covered by PhoenixKitAI.

### Fixed

- Post-merge review follow-ups (PR #18): flattened `AITranslatable.source_value/2`, aligned the blank-binary predicate across the adapter and binding, and fixed `credo --strict` alias ordering of the shared `FormGlue` alias in the three form LVs.

## 0.8.0 - 2026-06-01

**Nested sub-projects** — an assignment can now embed a whole child project in its parent's timeline *instead of* a task template, so a project becomes a first-class step inside another project. The child is the source of truth; its status, progress, planned hours, and completion **roll up** the tree (depth-capped, empty children neutral) and the linking row behaves like any task — drag to reorder, give it dependencies, remove it. Also adds a polymorphic **assignee on projects** (and therefore sub-projects), mirroring the one-of team/department/person shape assignments already use.

### Added

- **Sub-projects** (core V127 — `child_project_uuid` on `phoenix_kit_project_assignments`). An assignment carries *exactly one* of `task_uuid` / `child_project_uuid` (DB XOR check + `Assignment.validate_task_xor_child/1`). Context API: `create_subproject/2` (fresh child), `link_subproject/2` (nest an existing standalone project), `detach_subproject/1` (pop a child back out as standalone), `available_projects_to_link/1`. The single-parent guarantee is a partial unique index; cycles are blocked by an ancestor check serialized with a transaction-scoped advisory lock.
- **Rollup** — a linking row carries denormalized `status` / `progress_pct` / hours / completion synced from the child via `Assignment.subproject_changeset/2`; `recompute_project_completion/1` propagates changes up the parent chain after each child settles. Empty sub-projects are neutral in the progress average (kept in the count, dropped from the denominator).
- **`Projects.project_tree_summary/1`** — recursive per-node dashboard summary (task breakdown + nested child summaries), rendered by the reworked `running_card` component.
- **Assignee on projects** (core V128 — polymorphic `assigned_team_uuid` / `assigned_department_uuid` / `assigned_person_uuid`, one-of via a `num_nonnulls(...) <= 1` CHECK + `Project.validate_single_assignee/1`). `Projects.get_project_with_assignee/1` preloads it.
- **Helpers** — `Assignment.label/2` (locale-aware title for a task *or* sub-project, single render source of truth), `Assignment.subproject?/1`, and `Statuses.lock_status_source/2` (server-side freeze of the status source once a project has started).
- **UI** — sub-project rows on `ProjectShowLive` (expand/collapse inset child tasks, "Make standalone", "Open", remove-with-subtree), `AssignmentFormLive` sub-project mode ("create new child" / "nest existing project"), and a project-assignee picker on the project form.

### Changed

- **Minimum `phoenix_kit` is now `~> 1.7.128`** — the release shipping V127 (`child_project_uuid`, `task_uuid` made nullable, the task/child XOR check, single-parent unique index) and V128 (the project assignee columns). The features can't run on older cores.
- **Top-level listings, buckets, counts, and the workload tile exclude sub-projects** (`exclude_subprojects/1`) — an embedded child is reached through its parent's timeline, not as a standalone row. The exclusion is self-correcting: if the linking row disappears, the child re-surfaces at the top level.
- **Cloning a template deep-clones its sub-project subtree** — `create_project_from_template/2` recursively instantiates each sub-template into a fresh child project (the single-parent index forbids sharing), carrying multilang content, settings, status source, and assignee.
- **Deleting is subtree-aware** — `delete_project/1` and the sub-project clause of `delete_assignment/1` tear down the whole child subtree in one transaction (the `child_project_uuid` FK is `ON DELETE RESTRICT`, so children are removed explicitly, not orphaned).

### Fixed

- **Show-page progress matches the dashboard** — the project header now excludes empty sub-projects from the progress denominator, the same way `project_summaries/1` and `project_tree_summary/1` already did.
- **`delete_project/1` on a still-linked sub-project** returns `{:error, :still_a_subproject}` instead of raising `Ecto.ConstraintError` on the `ON DELETE RESTRICT` FK mid-transaction.
- **No `nil`-task crash on crafted events** — the `start` / `complete` / `reopen` / `track_progress` / `update_progress` handlers log activity metadata via the `nil`-safe `Assignment.label/1`, so an event aimed at a sub-project linking row (which has no task) can't dereference a nil task.
- **PR #16 review follow-ups** — clone fidelity (multilang/settings/assignee carried into deep clones), the link-cycle race (advisory lock), and child-task dependency rendering inside expanded sub-projects.

## 0.7.0 - 2026-05-31

User-defined **workflow statuses** for projects — a status vocabulary sourced from the optional `phoenix_kit_entities` catalog and **cemented locally when a project starts** (the module's template→instance philosophy), so a running project owns a frozen, independently-editable copy that later catalog edits don't touch. Also adds a free-form `external_id` reference, and folds in the PR #1/#12 follow-ups plus two rounds of post-merge review hardening.

### Added

- **Workflow statuses** (`PhoenixKitProjects.Statuses`) — an optional-dependency context (graceful degradation mirroring `Translations`: reads return `[]`/`nil`, provisioning returns `{:error, :entities_not_available}`, cementing is a no-op when entities is absent). A project draws its status list from a chosen `phoenix_kit_entities` catalog (or the admin-set global default); at `start_project/2` the list is snapshotted into the new `phoenix_kit_project_statuses` rows (`Schemas.ProjectStatus`) inside the same transaction. The selected status is addressed by a stable **slug** (`current_status_slug`), resolving against the live catalog before start and the cemented rows after.
- **Status localization** — primary-language titles are cemented as canonical labels and per-language overrides captured into each row's `translations` JSONB, resolved to the viewer's content locale on read. A **global default** ("show translated status titles") plus a per-project tri-state override gate display; translations are always captured regardless.
- **`/admin/settings/projects` page** (`ProjectsSettingsLive`, via `settings_tabs/0`) — pick the global default status list (or generate a starter one) and toggle translated-title display.
- **UI** — workflow-status badge, form status-source picker with live preview + "Generate default", show-page current-status picker, and a list-view status filter (`list_projects/1` / `count_projects/1` gain `:current_status_slug`).
- **`Project.external_id`** — free-form external reference (id/uuid/slug, max 255), included in the PubSub payload. No UI; set programmatically by host apps.
- **`Projects.scoped_assignments/2`** — single-query multi-endpoint scope check (used by dependency removal).

### Changed

- **Minimum `phoenix_kit` is now `~> 1.7.125`** — the V125 release that ships the workflow-status schema (`phoenix_kit_project_statuses` table + `status_entity_uuid` / `current_status_slug` / `settings` / `external_id` columns).
- **New optional dependency `phoenix_kit_entities` (`~> 0.2`)** — the status catalog source. Kept `optional: true` so it stays out of host closures; the feature degrades gracefully when it's absent.
- **`Project` schema** gains server-owned `status_entity_uuid` / `current_status_slug` (written only via `current_status_changeset/2`, never the form changeset) and a `settings` JSONB whose keys are whitelisted on cast.

### Fixed

- **PR follow-ups** — `unique_constraint` single-field edge (#9), `scoped_assignments/2` endpoint check in `remove_dependency` (#12), `validate_required(:counts_weekends)` (#16).
- **Re-cement is atomic** — switching a started project's status list updates the project, re-copies its local rows, and reconciles the selection in one transaction; `:project_updated` is broadcast only after commit, so a rollback can't leak a phantom event.
- **No dangling selection** — `current_status_slug` is cleared when a re-cement drops the selected status or when `remove_project_status/1` deletes the selected row.
- **`reverse_reference_count/1`** excludes started (cemented) projects, matching the entities "Used by N" semantics.
- **CSS-injection guard** — the badge only emits a colour into the inline `style` when it's bare hex; text colour is chosen by luminance for contrast.
- **`TranslateResourceWorker` uniqueness** — the `unique` state list now includes `:suspended` (added by Oban 2.20) so dedup covers every incomplete state and `compile --warnings-as-errors` stays clean.

## 0.6.0 - 2026-05-25

The projects / tasks / templates list views move onto `phoenix_kit`'s core list-UI toolkit and gain a strategy-driven bulk reorder, clickable column sort, and opt-in load-more pagination. The Task Library's Groups tab is reworked into a card-per-group layout.

### Added

- **Strategy-driven bulk reorder** — `Projects.reorder_projects_by/3`, `reorder_templates_by/3`, and `reorder_tasks_by/3` rewrite many positions at once by strategy (`:name_asc` / `:name_desc` / `:created_asc` / `:created_desc` / `:reverse`). Scope is either `:all` (rewrite every row contiguously) or a selected-uuid list ("permute in place" — selected rows are reordered within the slots they already occupy; untouched rows don't move). Writes are a two-phase negative→positive update inside a transaction, with `uuid`-sorted write order so concurrent permutes can't deadlock; a `uuid` tiebreaker keeps same-second `inserted_at` ties deterministic. Strategy is validated against a compile-time whitelist (no `String.to_existing_atom` on request input), and an over-cap or duplicate-position selection is rejected rather than silently mis-writing.
- **Sortable lists** — `list_projects/1` and `list_tasks/1` accept `:sort_by` + `:sort_dir` (projects: position / name / inserted_at / updated_at; tasks: position / title / inserted_at / estimated_duration), wired to a sort selector and clickable column headers. Manual (`:position`) mode keeps drag-and-drop; other sorts are a non-destructive *view* and hide the drag handle.
- **Opt-in load-more pagination** — `list_projects/1` / `list_tasks/1` gain a `:limit` opt; projects and tasks LVs default to load-more (50/batch) with a "Showing X of Y" footer, opt out via `live_render(... session: %{"pagination" => "off"})`.
- **Groups tab card layout** — each group renders as a card titled by its root task, with a prerequisite-count subtitle and a `root` badge, replacing the prior undifferentiated wall of lists.

### Changed

- **Minimum `phoenix_kit` is now `~> 1.7.121`** — it ships the core list-UI components these views render (`<.bulk_select_scope>`/toolbar/cells, `<.sortable_tbody>`/`<.sortable_row>`, `<.drag_handle_cell>`, `<.reorder_modal>`, `<.load_more>`). The projects-local `sortable_table` / `reorder_modal` / bulk-select copies are removed in favour of core.
- **`count_projects/0` is now `count_projects/1`** and takes the same filter opts as `list_projects/1`; the default excludes templates **and** archived projects (the old zero-arity counted both, over-counting against `list_projects`'s default). Affects the overview dashboard's project count.
- The projects list no longer offers the "Show" archived filter — it always lists active (non-archived) projects.

### Fixed

- `Web.Components.SmartLink`'s `:class` attr was declared `:string` but is passed a class list by the Groups tab; widened to `:any` (matches Phoenix core's `link/1`) so `mix compile --warnings-as-errors` stays clean.

## 0.5.1 - 2026-05-22

Follow-up review pass on the 0.5.0 AI-translation work — test coverage for the worker's retry classification plus minor internal cleanups. No behavior changes.

### Tests

- **5xx retry classification** — `TranslateResourceWorker.retryable?/1` (the transient-vs-deterministic decision behind retry-vs-discard) now has direct unit coverage pinning the provider-5xx allow-list (`500/502/503/504/522/524/529`), the deliberate `501`/`505` exclusion, 4xx, and non-HTTP discard cases. New `translate_resource_worker_retryable_test.exs` runs as a pure-function (no-DB) test, since in CI the AI plugin isn't loaded and the worker's job path can only surface `:ai_not_installed`.

### Changed

- `TranslateResourceWorker.retryable?/1` is now `@doc false` public (a unit-test seam, same as the existing `translate_now/1`); not part of the supported API.
- Internal cleanup: dropped a redundant identity `case` in `persist_translation_atomic/4` and corrected a stale code comment in `ProjectFormLive`'s save guard.

## 0.5.0 - 2026-05-21

AI-driven translation for projects, templates, and tasks — an Oban-backed worker plus an in-form translate UI — alongside a batch of field-report fixes (embedded-mount crash, partial-progress rollup, translatable templates, popup width).

### Added

- **AI translation** — `PhoenixKitProjects.Translations` public API (`enqueue/1`, `enqueue_all_missing/2`, AI endpoint/prompt resolution, and default-prompt provisioning) backed by `PhoenixKitProjects.Workers.TranslateResourceWorker`, an Oban worker that translates `Project` / `Template` / `Task` / `Assignment` translatable fields via the shared translation helper. Deterministic failures discard instead of retrying (no token burn), and failure reasons are sanitized before logging / activity-metadata writes.
- **`<.ai_translate_bar>` + AI Translation modal** on the project / template / task form LVs — a compact trigger above the multilang tabs with endpoint/prompt selectors and a scope picker (missing-only / all-overwrite / current tab). Hidden when AI is unavailable or on `:new`. Status streams over scoped per-resource PubSub; completion patches **only** the `translations` field of the live changeset, so unsaved edits survive a job finishing mid-edit.
- **Translatable templates** — `TemplateFormLive` gains the multilang plumbing (tabs, language switcher, translatable name + description) already present on projects.
- **Partial-progress rollup** — overall project progress now averages each assignment's `progress_pct` instead of counting only `done`. Project auto-completion stays binary (flips to `:completed` only when every assignment is `done`).
- **`Projects.get_projects/1`** — batch `%{uuid => Project}` lookup so host list views can avoid a per-row N+1.
- **`session["modal_box_class"]`** — `PopupHostLive` accepts a host-supplied modal-box width (default `w-11/12 max-w-6xl`).

### Changed

- Minimum `phoenix_kit` is now `~> 1.7.117` — it ships the shared translation parser/helper that the translation worker delegates to.
- Popup child frames now fill the modal box — `PopupHostLive` injects a full-width `wrapper_class` unless the host passes its own, fixing form LVs that stacked their standalone `max-w-xl` cap inside the popup.

### Fixed

- **Embedded `ProjectShowLive` comments-drawer crash** — switched bang-form `@phoenix_kit_current_scope` to bracket access, so off-router `live_render` mounts (which skip core's `on_mount`) no longer raise `KeyError` when the drawer opens.
- **AI unique-job window** — `TranslateResourceWorker` now sets `unique: [period: :infinity, …]`. The omitted period defaulted to 60s, which let a translation slower than a minute be enqueued a second time and burn tokens twice.
- **AI overwrite vs. open form** — the "all"/overwrite scope now overwrites translations in the open form too (mirroring the worker's persisted merge) instead of leaving stale values that a save would silently revert; missing/current scopes keep the blank-only edit protection.
- **AI mount cost + flash accuracy** — the five Settings/plugin lookups now run only on the connected mount (`mount/3` fires twice), and an empty-source completion flashes an accurate message instead of "Translated".

### Tests

- New `translations_test.exs` + `translate_resource_worker_test.exs` (argument validation, deterministic-failure discard, broadcast fan-out, merge + source-lang semantics, overwrite-flag propagation), `ai_translate_form_helpers_test.exs` + `ai_translate_bar_test.exs` (missing-language detection, merge policy, scope/visibility), and an `embedding_test.exs` regression that greps `lib/` for any `@phoenix_kit_*` bang-form reference.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-05-19

Adopts phoenix_kit core PR #551 — shared utilities consolidated upstream — plus emit-mode review follow-ups and UX polish.

### Changed

- **Prefixless admin URLs** — `Paths.*` helpers now resolve to `/admin/projects/...` instead of `/en/admin/projects/...` for the default locale, tracking `Routes.admin_path/2` from phoenix_kit core PR #551. Hosts with hardcoded locale-prefixed paths to project routes should re-check them.
- **Migrated to `PhoenixKit.Utils.{Reorder,Values}`** — the projects-local reorder and value-coercion helpers were dropped in favour of the consolidated core utilities.
- **Dropped local `<.empty_state>`** — list views now use the `PhoenixKitWeb.Components.Core` `empty_state/1` component lifted into phoenix_kit core.
- Minimum `phoenix_kit` is now `~> 1.7.114` (ships `Utils.Reorder`, `Utils.Values`, `core/empty_state`, and prefixless `admin_path`).

### Added

- **`<.assignment_status_badge>` component** — shared assignment-status presentation (`color/1`, `badge_class/1`, `label/1`), extracted from `ProjectShowLive` + `OverviewLive`.
- **`session["max_stack_depth"]`** — `PopupHostLive` accepts a host-supplied modal-stack cap (integer `1..20`, default 5; out-of-band values reset to the default with a logged warning).
- **`<.popup_host>` loading feedback** — per-frame daisyUI spinner overlay that auto-fades; `<.smart_link>` buttons get `cursor-pointer` + `phx-click-loading` CSS feedback.

### Fixed

- **`<.smart_link>` / `<.smart_menu_link>` render-time crash vector** — emit-session JSON now encodes via the non-bang `Helpers.encode_emit_session/3`, falling back to an empty session on failure instead of crashing the whole view.
- **`ProjectShowLive` fail-closed mount** now inherits the host locale, so the "Project not found." flash is localized.
- **`emit_telemetry/2`** builds its payload outside the rescue and rescues only around `:telemetry.execute/3`, so a misbehaved host telemetry handler can't crash the embed flow while bugs in this module still surface.
- **`mix precommit`** — credo alias, dialyzer `pattern_match_cov` on the reorder LiveViews, and formatting.

### Removed

- Dead `:embed_close_on` assign / `"close_on"` session key — reserved-but-unused; can be reintroduced when per-frame close-event opt-in is genuinely needed.

### Tests

- New pure-changeset suites — `schemas/project_test.exs` (26 tests: required/length validation, `start_mode` enum, `derived_status/2` cascade, `planned_end_for/2` + `eta_from/3` branches) and `schemas/dependency_test.exs` (required validation, self-reference rejection).

## 0.3.0 - 2026-05-15

Emit-mode navigation + PopupHostLive for embedded LiveViews, locale inheritance fixes, and UI polish.

### Added

- **Emit-mode contract** — embedded LVs can now broadcast UI-intent events (`:opened`, `:closed`, `:saved`, `:deleted`) on a host-supplied PubSub topic instead of calling top-level `push_navigate`. Pass `session["mode"] => "emit"` + `session["pubsub_topic"]` to any embedded LV. `session["redirect_to"]` from PR #6 stays supported in navigate mode (default).
- **`PopupHostLive`** — opinionated daisyUI modal-stack host for embedded LVs. Renders a root view inline, pushes follow-up views into `<dialog>` frames, and handles ESC / backdrop / race-safe pop via `frame_ref`.
- **`PhoenixKitProjects.Web.Helpers` embed utilities** — `assign_embed_state/2`, `attach_open_embed_hook/1`, `navigate_or_open/2`, `close_or_navigate/2`, `navigate_after_save/3`, `notify_deleted_or_navigate/4`, `notify_deleted/3`.
- **`<.smart_link>` + `<.smart_menu_link>` components** — render real `<a>` tags in navigate mode and `<button phx-click="open_embed">` in emit mode, with whitelist validation against `Helpers.embeddable_lvs/0`.
- **`<.popup_host>` component** — function-component wrapper for PopupHostLive session generation.
- **`dev_docs/embedding_emit.md`** — full emit-mode contract reference for host authors.

### Changed

- **Embedded LV locale inheritance** — `session["locale"]` is now threaded through PopupHostLive and restored in every stacked frame so translations stay consistent across modal opens.
- **Full-width default wrappers** — list and show LVs now default to `w-full` instead of `max-w-*` when embedded, giving hosts more layout control.
- **Project show header layout** — title + description are stacked; Edit / Archive actions moved into a kebab menu. Row actions in the assignment timeline converted to kebab menus for cleaner visuals.
- **Dependency upgrades** — `phoenix_live_view`, `phoenix_kit`, `phoenix_kit_staff`, and transitive deps updated to latest compatible versions.

### Fixed

- **Dialyzer warnings** — silenced pre-existing opaque-type warnings on `PopupHostLive` and `Helpers` via targeted `@dialyzer` annotations and `.dialyzer_ignore.exs` entries.
- **Duplicate alias** — removed a duplicate `Helpers` alias left by a rebase in `AssignmentFormLive`.

### Tests

- **Emit-mode regression gate** — `embedding_emit_test.exs` (53 tests) + `popup_host_live_test.exs` (27 tests) covering mount, event round-trips, `frame_ref` stamping, race-safe pops, stack-depth caps, and `next:` chaining.
- **Helper embed tests** — `helpers_embed_test.exs` (15 tests) covering `safe_internal_path?/1`, `assign_embed_state/2`, and emit-vs-navigate branching.

## 0.2.2 - 2026-05-13

Dialyzer clean-up + version sync.

### Fixed

- **`permission_metadata/0` callback type mismatch** — removed `gettext_backend`
  and `gettext_domain` keys that were not part of the `PhoenixKit.Module`
  `permission_meta()` type, which Dialyzer flagged as a `callback_type_mismatch`.
- **Gettext.Backend opaque warnings** — added `@dialyzer {:no_opaque, []}` to
  `PhoenixKitProjects.Gettext` and a `.dialyzer_ignore.exs` entry for the four
  `call_without_opaque` false positives generated by `Gettext.Backend` in
  gettext ≥ 0.26.
- **Version drift** — `def version/0` was returning `"0.2.0"` while `mix.exs`
  already declared `0.2.1`. Aligned both to the declared version.

## 0.2.1 - 2026-05-13

Embed support + ETA refactor + Phase 2 re-validation sweep (PR #6) plus
post-merge follow-up (review under
`dev_docs/pull_requests/2026/6-embed-and-quality/FOLLOWUP.md`).

### Added

- **Embeddable LiveViews** — all 9 LVs in the module can now be nested
  inside a host LiveView via `live_render/3` (issue #5). Each LV
  accepts a `:not_mounted_at_router` mount path, a session-overridable
  `wrapper_class`, and (for form LVs) a session-overridable
  `redirect_to`. Host apps can drop the module's own UI into their own
  workflow instead of re-implementing it against the contexts.
- **Shared embed plumbing in `PhoenixKitProjects.Web.Helpers`** —
  `resolve_live_action/3`, `resolve_action_params/2`, and
  `navigate_after_save/2` provide a single source of truth for the
  router-vs-embed mount path.
- **Open-redirect guard on `navigate_after_save/2`** —
  `session["redirect_to"]` is validated as a relative internal path
  (starts with `/`, not protocol-relative, no `://`) before any
  `push_navigate`. Protects embedders that naively forward an
  unvalidated `params["return_to"]` from a request query string.
- **Remaining + ETA stat** — `ProjectShowLive` now displays
  `Remaining: Xh · ETA: <datetime> at planned pace` in place of the
  previous Planned/Projected date pair. Anchored on `now` and the sum
  of remaining task hours rather than velocity. New `Project.eta_from/3`
  public API mirrors `planned_end_for/2` but accepts an arbitrary
  anchor datetime.
- **`dev_docs/embedding_audit.md`** — per-LV diagnosis of the three
  embed-blocker patterns (router-shaped `mount/3`, `handle_params/3`
  export, hardcoded wrapper class) and the test convention
  (`live_isolated/3` in `test/phoenix_kit_projects/web/embedding_test.exs`)
  that stops them from being re-introduced. 28 new contract tests.

### Changed

- **`handle_params/3` removed from list, show, and form LVs.** Phoenix
  LiveView refuses to mount a LV exporting `handle_params/3` outside a
  router live route, which would block `live_render` embedding. The
  bodies were folded into the tail of `mount/3`. (Reverses the 0.2.0
  refactor that had moved queries the other direction.)
- **`TasksLive` view toggle** moved from URL-driven `?view=list|groups`
  to `phx-click set_view`. The toggle is UI state, not a real route
  arg — making it a URL param required `handle_params/3` (now
  removed for embedability) and meant deep links could collide with
  per-user preference.
- **Empty-content pop-in eliminated on first paint** for Tier 1/2 LVs
  (`OverviewLive`, `ProjectsLive`, `TemplatesLive`, `TasksLive`) by
  dropping the `connected?(socket)` gate around data loading in
  `mount/3`. First HTTP response now contains content rather than a
  skeleton that the WebSocket-connected mount then replaces.
- **`mix precommit` auto-formats before checking** — `format` prepended
  to the alias so unformatted files are rewritten before
  `quality.ci`'s `format --check-formatted` verifies. `quality.ci`
  keeps the check-only variant for CI.

### Fixed

- **Dead `archived` key in PubSub broadcast payload** — `project_payload/1`
  was building `archived: not is_nil(p.archived_at)` but every
  subscriber pattern-matched on `{:projects, event, _payload}` and
  re-fetched via `get_project/1` when archived state mattered.
  Removed.
- **Unreachable `safe_internal_path?/1` catch-all** in
  `Web.Helpers` — the second clause was dead code because the only
  caller already narrows the value to a non-empty binary; Dialyzer
  flagged it as unreachable.
- **PR #4 follow-up** — docstring symmetry on reorder helpers (Phase 1
  triage of `CLAUDE_REVIEW.md`).

## 0.2.0 - 2026-05-11

### Added

- **Multilang content** — project name/description, task title/description, and
  assignment description are now translatable via core's Languages module.
  Forms auto-render `<.multilang_tabs>` when 2+ languages are enabled; primary
  values stay in their columns, overrides live in a `translations JSONB`.
- **Task groups view** — task templates can be grouped by dependency tree in the
  task-library UI, with visual `→ X` badges showing outgoing edges.
- **Drag-and-drop reorder** — projects, templates, and tasks can be reordered
  via sortable tables with `phx-reorder` events. Dedup logic guarantees
  last-write-wins on duplicate UUIDs.
- **Closure-pull cascade** — adding a task to a project can optionally pull in
  its entire upstream dependency closure with automatic `Dependency` wiring and
  execution-order position assignment.
- **Slide-in comments drawer** — `ProjectShowLive` now supports a per-resource
  comments side-panel with live count badges.
- **Running dashboard prioritization** — the Overview tab now surfaces late and
  near-done projects first, with tier pills (`:late`, `:near_done`, `:on_track`).
- **Derived status + soft-hide archive** — replaced the string `status` column
  with `archived_at` timestamp. `Project.derived_status/2` returns `:running`,
  `:completed`, `:overdue`, `:scheduled`, `:setup`, `:archived`, or `:template`.
  `Projects.archive_project/1` / `unarchive_project/1` are the public API.
- **Reusable UI components** — extracted `<.derived_status_badge>`,
  `<.empty_state>`, `<.page_header>`, `<.running_card>`, `<.sortable_table>`,
  `<.stat_tile>`, `<.tabs_strip>`, and `<.tier_pill>` from the large LiveViews
  into individual `PhoenixKitProjects.Web.Components.*` modules.
- **`handle_params/3` refactor** — all list, show, and form LiveViews moved their
  initial DB queries from `mount/3` to `handle_params/3` so HTTP render and
  WebSocket connect share a single query path.
- **Translations JSONB validation** — schema changesets now validate the shape
  of incoming `translations` maps to prevent malformed JSONB inserts.

### Changed

- `build_group_tree/4` and `build_closure_tree/3` switched from `cond do` with
  a single non-`true` clause to `if/else` (credo compliance).
- `wire_closure_dependencies/3` nesting reduced by extracting
  `wire_child_dependency/4` and `wire_assignment_dependency/2`.
- `is_template_attr?/1` renamed to `template_attr?/1` per Elixir naming
  conventions.

### Fixed

- **Diamond-dependency skip in closure pull** — a task reachable via both an
  excluded and a non-excluded parent is now correctly emitted once when the
  non-excluded branch reaches it.
- **O(n²) topo append eliminated** — `topological_insertion_order/2` now builds
  the list in reverse and flips once at the end.
- **Duration editor prefill** — the inline duration editor in `ProjectShowLive`
  now falls back to the task template's default values when the assignment has
  no explicit duration.
- **Inline duration editor UX** — improved hover contrast, control sizing, and
  input prefill behavior.
- **Precommit hygiene** — resolved all credo strict issues and suppressed a
  Dialyzer false-positive on recursive `MapSet` opacity.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-04-30

Quality sweep + re-validation pass (PR #2) plus post-merge follow-up
fixes (PR #2 review).

### Added

- `Activity.log_failed/2` helper that tags `metadata.db_pending = true`
  so audit-feed readers can distinguish attempted-but-failed mutations
  from completed ones during a DB outage.
- `@spec` declarations across the public `Projects` context API
  (~32 functions) plus shared `@type uuid` and `@type error_atom`.
- `error_summary/2` translates Ecto validator messages via
  `Gettext.dgettext`/`dngettext` against the `errors` domain, and
  humanizes field names in the cross-field flash summary.
- Test infrastructure: full LiveView smoke-test stack
  (`PhoenixKitProjects.LiveCase`, `Test.Endpoint`, `Test.Router`,
  `assign_scope` hook, `assert_activity_logged/2`), self-contained
  setup migration under `test/support/postgres/migrations/`, and
  `test.setup` / `test.reset` mix aliases.

### Changed

- `Activity.log/2` rescue widened to the canonical post-Apr shape
  (`Postgrex.Error -> :ok`, `DBConnection.OwnershipError -> :ok`,
  `e -> Logger.warning`, `catch :exit, _ -> :ok`).
- `enabled?/0` gained `catch :exit, _ -> false` for sandbox-shutdown
  resilience.
- `recompute_project_completion/1` now wraps the read + check + update
  in a transaction so two concurrent assignment status changes can't
  double-mark a project completed.
- `add_dependency/2` runs the cycle check + insert in a `:serializable`
  transaction; concurrent edge inserts that would close a cycle now
  fail with a friendly retry-hint changeset error.
- `create_project_from_template/2` opens its outer transaction at
  `:serializable` so the cycle-race protection inside `add_dependency/2`
  actually applies on the template-cloning path (Postgres ignores
  isolation level on nested transactions).
- All 5 admin LiveViews emit `Logger.debug` on `handle_info` catch-alls
  (was silent).
- `phx-disable-with` on every destructive `phx-click` site
  (`project_show_live` × 9, `assignment_form_live` × 3, `task_form_live` × 2,
  delete buttons in `projects_live` / `tasks_live` / `templates_live`).
- `Project.changeset/2` `name_index_for/2` picks the partial-index
  constraint name based on `is_template`, so a template and a project
  can share a name freely. Coercion accepts the full set of truthy
  forms (`true`, `"true"`, `"1"`, `1`, `"on"`).
- Cross-module schema typespecs relaxed to `struct() | nil` until
  `phoenix_kit_staff` 0.1.1 ships `@type t` declarations
  (tracking: `BeamLabEU/phoenix_kit_staff#3`).

### Fixed

- `add_dependency/2` was TOCTOU under concurrent inserts (PR #1
  review #2).
- `assignment_status_counts/0` was filtering on `is_template == false`
  but not `status == "active"`, inflating the dashboard's todo /
  in_progress / done totals with archived projects' assignments
  (PR #1 review #4).
- Template + project name unique-constraint collision via core's
  V105 partial-index split (PR #1 review #5).
- `apply_template_dependencies/1` rollback no longer silently
  swallowed — surfaces a `:warning` flash + Logger.warning
  (PR #1 review #6).
- `do_update_progress/3`, `save_duration`, and `remove_dependency`
  in `ProjectShowLive` now route their error branches through
  `Activity.log_failed/2`, closing the `db_pending: true` invariant
  gap surfaced by the PR #2 review.
- `test_helper.exs` no longer hard-fails when `psql` is missing —
  the reachability probe falls through to the connect-attempt path,
  matching the AGENTS.md "never hard-fail on a missing DB" contract.

### Coverage / quality

- Test count: 56 → 355 (+299), 0 flakes across 10/10 stable runs.
- Line coverage: 37.02% → 91.80%.
- Dialyzer: 6 pre-existing unknown-type warnings → 0 errors.
- Credo `--strict`: 0 issues.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-04-20

- Initial release: project + task management with polymorphic assignees
  (team / department / person), per-project and template-level dependencies
  with cycle detection, atomic template cloning, weekday-aware schedule math,
  PubSub broadcasts, and activity logging.
