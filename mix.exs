      # `TemplatesLive` all `use` — including the `mode: :history` option they
      # depend on to stay embeddable, which landed in the same release. It
      # supersedes the earlier floors, which it still satisfies —
      # V125/V127/V128 for the workflow-status schema and the project-assignee
      # columns, 1.7.184 for the `disabled` / `wrapper_class` / `title` /
      # `:description` attrs on `PhoenixKitWeb.Components.Core.Checkbox`, and
      # 1.7.189 for `PhoenixKit.SchemaPrefix`, which every table-backed schema
      # in this module applies.

      # Bounded with a TWO-segment `~>` on purpose: `>= 2.0.0 and < 3.0.0`.
      # Core majors are not assumed compatible, but core MINORS must be — a
      # requirement that excludes one breaks `mix deps.get` outright for every

      # only on consumers. `core_pin_conformance_test.exs` guards this; it is
      # the reason a real floor is documented here rather than encoded.
      #
      # The floor is 2.38.0: project files live on core's
      # `Storage.ResourceFolders`, the reorganizer on its `ResourceSource`,
      # the actor and activity log come from `PhoenixKitWeb.Actor` and
      # `Activity.log/3`, file helpers from `Utils.Format`, and the edit forms
      # use `mount_multilang(open_on:)` — all first shipped there, none
      # feature-detected, so a lower core fails to compile. Earlier floors it
      # supersedes: 2.14.2 (core V183 annotation anchors, `<.modal>`'s
      # `placement` / `close_guard`, `<.nav_tabs>`' `:trailing` slot),
      # 1.7.231 for `PhoenixKitWeb.Live.UrlState`, 1.7.189 for
      # `PhoenixKit.SchemaPrefix`, and V125/V127/V128 for the workflow-status
      # and project-assignee columns. Patch-precise floor in the compound
